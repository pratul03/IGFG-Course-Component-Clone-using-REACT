        <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong> refer to the study
        of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures
        (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data
        structures. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer
        science student must have. It is often seen that people with good
        knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and
        thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant, including
        companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook (now Meta). This
        DSA tutorial aims to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
        quickly and easily.
