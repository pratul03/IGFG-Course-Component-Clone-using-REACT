          "A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque.",

        content:
          "A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers (in C or C++) or references (in Java, Python and JavaScript). Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list, as the nodes are not stored contiguously in memory.",
